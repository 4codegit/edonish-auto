Agent: Main
Task: Fix grade logic, auto-detect quarter, add signature feature, rebuild release

Work Log:
- Analyzed current codebase: main.py, grade_engine.py, api_client.py, config.py
- Identified root cause: MIN_GRADE=8 in config makes grade range 8-10, plus mark_type_id=8 was confusing
- Changed MIN_GRADE from 8 to 3, MAX_GRADE stays at 10
- Added weighted_random_grade() function with bell-curve distribution (favors 7-9, rare 3-4 and 10)
- Added auto-detection of current quarter in _detect_current_quarter() using API date ranges or month-based fallback
- Added signature feature: checkbox + text field + separate button
- Added execute_signatures() method in GradeEngine using JOURNAL_COMMENT API endpoint
- Added create_comment() method in EdonishAPI client
- Signature is applied automatically after grades when checkbox is enabled
- Bumped version to 3.2.0
- Pushed to main and created tag v3.2.0
- CI pipeline triggered successfully

Stage Summary:
- v3.2.0 pushed with all fixes
- Grade logic: weighted random 3-10 instead of uniform 8-10
- Quarter: auto-detected based on current date
- Signature: new feature to add comments/signatures to students
- CI pipeline running (#26843408474)

Task: Fix edonish-auto GUI crash (flet-desktop not bundled) and release v3.0.1

Work Log:
- Read main.py, build.yml, spec files, config.py, package.sh to understand the codebase
- Identified root cause: `flet-desktop` package was not being installed or bundled by PyInstaller
- Fixed main.py: removed `MaterialState` (removed in Flet 0.25+), removed `MatplotlibChart` (unused), added `IconButton` to imports, fixed `border.only()` -> `Border.only()`
- Fixed build.yml: added `pip install flet-desktop`, added `--hidden-import=flet_desktop` and `--collect-all flet_desktop` to all 3 build jobs (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Rewrote edonish-auto.spec for Flet (was still referencing CustomTkinter)
- Updated requirements.txt to include `flet-desktop>=0.25.0`
- Bumped version to 3.0.1 in config.py, package.sh, edonish-auto.spec.rpm
- Resolved git merge conflict (remote had a parallel fix attempt)
- Pushed to GitHub and created v3.0.1 tag to trigger CI/CD release build

Stage Summary:
- All code fixes committed and pushed to main branch
- v3.0.1 tag created and pushed → CI/CD pipeline triggered
- Key fix: `flet-desktop` is now installed and bundled in PyInstaller builds
- Release will include: .exe (Windows), .rpm + .deb (Linux), .dmg (macOS)
